  m_text: "Types\n\r\n<size=200% >Light Infantry</size>\r\n\nDescription\r\nThe Light
    Infantry, quick and nimble, serve as the agile vanguard of the battlefield. With
    minimal armor to maximize their mobility, they are equipped with a long spear
    and a solid shield. Their helmets, often decorated with distinctive plumes or
    markings, embody their valor and swiftness. These warriors are adept at swift
    attacks and fast retreats, outflanking heavier opponents with ease.\r\n\r\nStats\r\nHealth:
    30\r\n\r\nAttack: 10\r\n\r\nSpeed: 4\r\n\r\nMove range: 2\r\n\r\nDefense: 1\n\r\n\r<size=200%
    >Skirmisher</size>\n\r\nDescription\r\nSkirmishers are the masters of hit-and-run
    tactics. They carry a multitude of throwable spears and a light shield, allowing
    them to barrage the enemy with a hail of javelins before slipping away. Their
    lack of armor is compensated by their speed and agility. Skirmishers are perfect
    for harassing enemy formations and disrupting their plans.\r\n\r\nStats\r\nHealth:
    20\r\n\r\nAttack: 10\r\n\r\nSpeed: 4\r\n\r\nMove range: 3\r\n\r\nDefense: 0\r\n\r\n<size=200%
    >Hoplite</size>\n\r\nDescription\r\nThe backbone of any ancient army, the Hoplite
    is a heavily armored warrior. Equipped with a long spear, a large shield, and
    a full suit of armor, they are a formidable presence on the battlefield. Their
    helmets, often with crests, provide both protection and intimidation. Hoplites
    are the stalwarts of defense and a powerful force in a phalanx formation.\r\n\r\nStats\r\nHealth:
    40\r\n\r\nAttack: 15\r\n\r\nSpeed: 3\r\n\r\nMove range: 2\r\n\r\nDefense: 3\r\n\r\n<size=200%
    >Archer</size>\r\n\nDescription\r\nArchers are the long-range specialists. Wearing
    no armor to ensure freedom of movement, they are equipped with a sturdy bow and
    a quiver full of arrows. Their helmets are designed for visibility and protection.
    Skilled in targeting foes from a distance, archers provide essential support
    by weakening enemy lines before the main assault.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStats\r\nHealth:
    30\r\n\r\nAttack: 10\r\n\r\nSpeed: 4\r\n\r\nMove range: 2\r\n\r\nDefense: 2\r\n\r\n<size=200%
    >Chariot</size>\n\r\nDescription\r\nThe Chariot is a symbol of power and prestige.
    Drawn by two strong horses, it carries a single warrior who commands this swift
    and deadly vehicle. The rider, protected by a helmet, wields either a bow or
    a spear. Chariots are used for rapid assaults, breaking through enemy lines or
    chasing down fleeing foes.\r\n\r\nStats\r\nHealth: 40\r\n\r\nAttack: 20\r\n\r\nSpeed:
    5\r\n\r\nMove range: 4\r\n\r\nDefense: 4\r\n\r\n<size=200% >Catapult</size>\n\r\nDescription\r\nOperated
    by a team of two, the Catapult is a siege engine capable of hurling large projectiles
    over great distances. The crew, skilled in mechanics and trajectory calculations,
    work in unison to load, aim, and fire the catapult. They play a crucial role
    in besieging fortifications and providing artillery support.\r\n\r\nStats\r\nHealth:
    50\r\n\r\nAttack: 20\r\n\r\nSpeed: 2\r\n\r\nMove range: 1\r\n\r\nDefense: 4\r\n\r\n<size=200%
    >Elephant</size>\n\r\nDescription\r\nThe War Elephant is a towering beast clad
    in armor, carrying two warriors on its back. One driver steers this mighty creature
    while the other, often armed with a bow or javelin, attacks from this elevated
    position. War Elephants are used to cause chaos in enemy ranks, trampling soldiers
    and breaking through barriers.\r\n\r\nStats\r\nHealth: 70\r\n\r\nAttack: 20\r\n\r\nSpeed:
    5\r\n\r\nMove range: 3\r\n\r\nDefense: 6\r\n\r\n<size=150% >Unit level</size>\r\nObtaining
    experience\r\nEvery unit starts with level 1. In order to level up and become
    stronger, unit must kill enemy units.\r\n\r\nExperience obtained after killing
    = level of killed unit.\r\n\r\nFor example: after killing an unit with level
    1, killer gets 1 point of experience and after killing an unit with level 3,
    killer gets 3 points of experience.\r\n\r\nLevel-uping\r\nTo level up unit needs
    to obtain certain amount of experience.\r\n\r\nTo level up from level 1 to 2
    unit need 2 points of experience, to level up from level 2 to 3 unit needs 4
    points of experience, etc.\r\r\n\r\nMaximum level\r\nMaximum level unit can reach
    is 5. After that, there is no possibility to level up.\r\n\r\nWhat happens after
    level up\r\nAfter unit reaches a certain amount of experience, that allows it
    to level up, a player can choose what statistics he wants to upgrade in given
    unit.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 options:\r\n\r\nStatistics\r                   /Amount
    added to current value  / Additional info\r\n\r\n\r\nHealth / 5 /  When increasing
    this statistics, unit increases its maximum health, as well as current health.
    Good for every unit, but especially those that are easy to kill or are very important
    to a player.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttack\r             /  5  /  Good for those units that
    are usually used as main fighters in a battle.\r\n\r\n\r\nDefense\r               
    / 2 /  Good for more defensive or strategic units. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo lets say we
    have a hoplite that got injured in a battle but finally won and can level up.
    He has currently a 23 points of health and maximum 40. Player has decided that
    he wants this unit to live longer because he is very strong and has a good strategic
    position. So he decided to upgrade health statistic. After that hoplite has maximum
    health of 45 and current health 28. \r\n\r\nFight\r\nAfter clicking on an enemy
    unit in range of movement, the unit will attack the enemy. The damage is calculated:\r\n\r\nDamage
    = [attack stat of attacker] - [defense of unit attacked]\r\n\r\nAfter the units
    health reaches 0, the unit dies. After that the money and experience is being
    given for the attacker."
